# Ex.No:1(B) CONDITIONAL STATEMENT

## QUESTION:
In a magical building, an elevator behaves oddly:
If the floor number is divisible by 3 and 5, it says "Skipped".
If the floor number is divisible by 3 only, it says "Beware!".

If the floor number is divisible by 5 only, it says "Blessings!".

Otherwise, it announces the floor number - print - "Floor {number}" .

Write a Java program to simulate this elevator logic for a given floor number.
## AIM:


## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Import the necessary package 'java.util'
